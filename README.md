`gocovsh` is a tool for exploring [Go Coverage
reports](https://go.dev/blog/cover) from the command line.
[Screenshots](#screenshots) below.

## Installation

### Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
# make sure brew is installed
brew tap orlangure/tap
brew update
brew install gocovsh
```

### Pre-built binary

Grab your pre-built binary from the
[Releases](https://github.com/orlangure/gocovsh/releases) page.

### From source

```bash
# install latest, probably unreleased version
go install github.com/orlangure/gocovsh@latest

# or install a specific version
go install github.com/orlangure/gocovsh@v0.1.0
```

## Usage

1. Generate Go coverage report at your project's root with
    ```bash
    go test -cover -coverprofile coverage.out
    ```

   For more information about generating Go coverage reports, see [my blog
   post](https://fedorov.dev/posts/2020-06-27-golang-end-to-end-test-coverage/).

2. Run `gocovsh` at the same folder with `coverage.out` report and `go.mod`
   file (`go.mod` is required).

   ```bash
   gocovsh
   gocovsh --profile profile.out # for other coverage profile names
   ```

3. Use `j/k/enter/esc` keys to explore the report. See built-in help for more
   key-bindings.
